1) Create a folder for your portable QGIS, i.e "QGIS_2.18.28"

2) In this folder add the batch file (qgis.bat) and create a folder "qgis"

3) Place the content of C:/Program Files (x86 or x64)/QGIS 2.18/ in this directory

4) Now you should have something like this

QGIS_2.18.28
+-- qgis.bat
+-- _qgis
    +-- _apps
    +-- _bin
    +-- _etc
    +-- _icons
    +-- _include
    +-- _qgisconfig (after first run)
    +-- _qgisoptions (after first run)
    +-- _share
    +-- msvcp110.dll
    +-- ~8 other files
